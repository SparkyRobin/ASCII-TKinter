# ASCII-TKinter
PIL and TKinter are used in this project. The environment used to run this program must have both libraries installed.

To run ensure that Main.py, ASCII.txt, ASCIIartchars.txt and colours.txt are saved in the same folder.

To use on a picture, save said picture into the same folder.
It works best on pictures with lots of block colour.
Is not optimised at all for it's task, so will take a long time to complete for higher resolution images.
